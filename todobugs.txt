- Need system to pick any kanji for hero
- Game Over is ugly, make proper menu
- Improve performance (duh). Optimize update loop (duh). Can wait until much later
- Add animated backgrounds. JS animations? Change color as time passes and/or with enemy stages?
- Longterm: allow for arbitrary kanjis to be selected as enemies
- Track kanjis killed by player
- Track challenges completed successfully and failures. Possible improvement: roll frequent failures more often!
- Add seed, make game logic fully deterministic, allow recording and record player input for 1:1 playback
- Make perks unlockable (need many more perks). Tied to:
1) full minutes survived. good, scales well and naturally with difficulty
2) total deaths. could be 1, 4, 9... squares. might scale ok?
3) individual kanji kills. could be 10, 100, 1000. if we want to learn 2100 kanjis, that's 6300 perks. probably unrealistic!
but the system could work for the first xxx kanjis. or, unlocks could be 10 for kanji A, 20 for kanji B, 30 for kanji C... regardless of what A B and C are
after 100 perks we need 1000 kills of a new kanji for a perk unlock. good for longterm progression, but might be tedious
ideal system would mesh learning and unlocks by "retiring" kanjis with unlocks and rotating in favor of new one.
fixed at high value (perhaps 1k) would make more sense with that latter design
- allow card/challenge navigation with keyboard only (select first card by default, up/down move to input box, left/right between cards, highlight in gold)
- poison resets tween to base = cold+poison = back to base despite cold
- no player damage visual post Oblivion, maybe caused by shield visual? testing, doesn't seem directly linked or alone
- change all coordinates to be relative, not absolute
- if player dies during the visual kanji intro of new rank, kanjis remain
- still possible to "beat" the game, want to rethink rank spawns

POSSIBLE FIX BUT NEEDS TESTING
- if OBLIVION BLOSSOM is selected during time slowdown, the player stays slow <= possibly fixed by window.TimeDilationSystem.cleanup();, need testing
- storm caller, divine beacon and alien beacon remain after BLOSSOM (didn't we fix this before, for divine?? maybe just restart...) -> possibly fixed

DONE
- storm beacon does not spawn immediately -> ok with "apply" instead of "call" (why??)
- amber nova triggers too much in late game with defensive burst, this kills framerate -> removed comps on defensive burst
- return storm vengeance to random? circle looks artificial = yes
- tentacle doesn't go away on oblivion blossom
- time slowdown fails to affect orbits and tweens <= think we'll live with this and call it a quirk
- picking up clock during slowdown period fails to activate effect <= should be fixed
- speed sometimes doesn't reset <= probably fixed with basePlayerSpeed, but that's a bit of a hack
- cold projectiles stack infinitely <= should be fixed, more testing needed
- Move remaining perks outside of index.html (orbiting? landmine?) orbiting done. landmine+afterimage next
- hide cursor! = after 1s delay
- T3 enemies? = up to T6
- Remove health factor increase for enemies, we will never use this
- Potentially rethink Fated Shield / Blue Whale / any shield interaction (common timer affecting Blue Whale). Might also be ok as is
^ not ok, Fated Shield respawns immediately if cd is already done. Too strong!
^^ changing my mind on this again. We'll see. Leave this here for consideration
^^^ am ok with this so far
- Arrange timer, P.A.L.E.
- add screen coloring on damage taken
