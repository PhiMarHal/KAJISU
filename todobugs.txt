- Eternal Rhythm is lost after a pause (including level ups)
- Enemies Killed is duplicated in UI
- Arrange timer, P.A.L.E.
- Need system to pick any kanji for hero
- Game Over is ugly, make proper menu
- Move remaining perks outside of index.html (orbiting? landmine?)
- Remove health factor increase for enemies, we will never use this
- Improve performance (duh). Optimize update loop (duh). Can wait until much later
- Add animated backgrounds. JS animations? Change color as time passes and/or with enemy stages?
- Longterm: allow for arbitrary kanjis to be selected as enemies
- Track kanjis killed by player
- Track challenges completed successfully and failures. Possible improvement: roll frequent failures more often!
- Add seed, make game logic fully deterministic, allow recording and record player input for 1:1 playback
- Potentially rethink Fated Shield / Blue Whale / any shield interaction (common timer affecting Blue Whale). Might also be ok as is
