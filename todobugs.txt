- Eternal Rhythm is lost after a pause (including level ups)
- Enemies Killed is duplicated in UI
- Arrange timer, P.A.L.E.
- Need system to pick any kanji for hero
- Game Over is ugly, make proper menu
- Move remaining perks outside of index.html (orbiting? landmine?)
- Remove health factor increase for enemies, we will never use this
- Improve performance (duh). Optimize update loop (duh). Can wait until much later
- Add animated backgrounds. JS animations? Change color as time passes and/or with enemy stages?
- Longterm: allow for arbitrary kanjis to be selected as enemies
- Track kanjis killed by player
- Track challenges completed successfully and failures. Possible improvement: roll frequent failures more often!
- Add seed, make game logic fully deterministic, allow recording and record player input for 1:1 playback
- Potentially rethink Fated Shield / Blue Whale / any shield interaction (common timer affecting Blue Whale). Might also be ok as is
^ not ok, Fated Shield respawns immediately if cd is already done. Too strong!
- Make perks unlockable (need many more perks). Tied to:
1) full minutes survived. good, scales well and naturally with difficulty
2) total deaths. could be 1, 4, 9... squares. might scale ok?
3) individual kanji kills. could be 10, 100, 1000. if we want to learn 2100 kanjis, that's 6300 perks. probably unrealistic!
but the system could work for the first xxx kanjis. or, unlocks could be 10 for kanji A, 20 for kanji B, 30 for kanji C... regardless of what A B and C are
after 100 perks we need 1000 kills of a new kanji for a perk unlock. good for longterm progression, but might be tedious
ideal system would mesh learning and unlocks by "retiring" kanjis with unlocks and rotating in favor of new one.
fixed at high value (perhaps 1k) would make more sense with that latter design
- Streamline Afterimages = change it to follow same logic as landmines, images stay at a spot for playerLuck secs and deal contact damage while they last
- double contact damage? perhaps even 2.5x (400ms ticks instead of 1s?)
